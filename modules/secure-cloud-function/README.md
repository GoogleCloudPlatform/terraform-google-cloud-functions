# Secure Cloud Function

This module handles the deployment required for Cloud Function (2nd Gen) usage. Secure-cloud-function module will call the secure-cloud-function-core, secure-cloud-serverless-net and secure-cloud-function-security modules.

When using a Shared VPC, you can chose where to create the VPC Connector.

_Note:_ When using a single VPC you should provides VPC and Serverless project id with the same value and the value for `connector_on_host_project` variable must be `false`.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

* secure-cloud-serverless-network module will apply:
  * Creates Firewall rules on your **VPC Project**.
    * Serverless to VPC Connector
    * VPC Connector to Serverless
    * VPC Connector to LB
    * VPC Connector Health Checks
  * Creates a sub network to VPC Connector usage purpose.
  * Creates Serverless Connector on your **VPC Project** or **Serverless Project**. Refer the comparison below:
    * Advantages of creating connectors in the [VPC Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#host-project)
    * Advantages of creating connectors in the [Serverless Project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/connecting-shared-vpc#service-projects)
  * Grant the necessary roles for Cloud Function are able to use VPC Connector on your Shared VPC when creating VPC Connector in host project.
    * Grant Network User role to Cloud Services service account.
    * Grant VPC Access User to Cloud Function Service Identity when deploying VPC Access.

* secure-cloud-function-security module will apply:
  * Creates KMS Keyring and Key for [customer managed encryption keys](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/using-cmek) in the **KMS Project** to be used by Cloud Function (2nd Gen).
  * Enables Organization Policies related to Cloud Function (2nd Gen) in the **Serverless Project**.
    * Allow Ingress only from internal and Cloud Load Balancing.
    * Allow VPC Egress to Private Ranges Only.
  * When groups emails are provided, this module will grant the roles for each persona.
    * Serverless administrator - Service Project
      * roles/run.admin
      * roles/cloudfunctions.admin
      * roles/compute.networkViewer
